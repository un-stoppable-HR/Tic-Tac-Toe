# Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, written in **HTML, CSS & JavaScript**.

## How to Play
To play the game, simply download or clone the repository and open the _index.html_ file in your web browser. Alternatively, you can play the game online at [insert link to game].

Once the game has loaded, you will be prompted to enter the names of the two players. If you don't want to enter player names, the game will use default names ("Player 1" and "Player 2"). Once you have entered the player names (or chosen to use the default names), click on the **"Start New Game"** button to begin playing.

To make a move, simply click on the cell where you want to place your mark (X or O). The game will automatically switch turns between the two players until one player wins or there are no more empty cells on the board.

## Features
- Two players can play the game (X and O)
- Player names can be entered or default names are used
- The game board is displayed on a web page
- Players make moves by clicking on the game board using a mouse
- The game checks for a winner after every move
- The game ends when there is a winner or a tie

## Future Improvements
Here are some potential improvements that could be made to this game:

- Add an AI player that can play against a human player
- Allow players to choose their mark other than X or O (e.g., #, *, or another symbol)
- Improve the user interface with better styling and graphics
- Add sound effects and animations to make the game more engaging
